Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Newborn Sepsis Cases in MIMIC-III Database

Description:
This SQL script is designed to perform a comprehensive EDA focused on sepsis-related admissions in the MIMIC-III clinical database. The analysis covers various aspects including frequency of sepsis diagnoses, filtering ICD9 codes for sepsis and septicemia, detailed examination of neonatal sepsis cases, and comparisons with established sepsis criteria by Angus et al., and Martin et al. The goal is to derive insights into the prevalence, demographics, and outcomes of sepsis patients within the database.

Scope:
- Identification and frequency analysis of sepsis-related diagnoses.
- Filtering and analysis of ICD9 codes specifically indicating sepsis and septicemia.
- Detailed examination of admissions associated with neonatal sepsis.
- Comparison of identified neonatal sepsis cases with Angus/Martin criteria for sepsis.
- Analysis of patient demographics and outcomes, including gender and ethnicity distribution, and mortality rates among sepsis patients.
- To be added

Prerequisites:
- Access to the MIMIC-III database with appropriate permissions.
- Familiarity with SQL and the structure of the MIMIC-III database.

Notes:
- Ensure the search_path is set to mimiciii before executing the queries.
- Review and adjust the threshold values and conditions as necessary for your specific analysis needs.
